I continued my experimental study and created scripts to inject each data quality error to automate the process and make it quicker. I first created visualizations with the clean data to use for comparison against the visualizations with the injected data issue. I met with Professor Fariha to discuss findings and get feedback. 

This week's research paper discussion was led by me. I created a presentation for the paper "The Battleship Approach to the Low Resource Entity Matching Problem". I found this paper to be quite interesting as they took the game Battleship and used the strategy of the game to solve low resources enitity matching.
