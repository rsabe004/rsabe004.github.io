title: Week 5

I started wrapping up my previous task this week and documenting what common data quality issues I encountered and what type of data visualization issues they produced. I made a connection between each data quality issue and their resulting visualization issues based on the results from the MET dataset. I then created a table to organize the visualizations I previously created and categorized them with the different mirage issues to help me gain a better understanding of each issue. I discussed these findings with professor Fariha during our meeting.
