title: Week 4

This week I continued with creating visualizations from the MET dataset from last week. I also created a slide deck to present my research findings so far to two faculty members from the University of Utah -- Dr. Andrew McNutt and Dr. Kate Isaacs. Professor Fariha set up a meeting with us to discuss the research topic and gain insight from them and guidance towards an experimental study. I gained many good points from them on what to consider when designing an experimental study. Some of these points included: defining my audience, what type of issues and tasks to focus on, what tasks matter the most, what would the error debugging process look like, how can people process dealing with these issues, etc. Overall, it was an insightful meeting to gain a different point of view on the study. 

This week's literature review was on the research paper: View-based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks.
