title: Week 10
---

This was my final week of the DREU program. I started wrapping up my experimental study although I was not able to get through all 10 datasets with the given time, I was still able to document the patterns and observations I encountered. I met with professor Fariha for a final time to discuss my research findings and what conclusions I drew. She also gave me insight on research in academia vs research in the industry, which I found was helpful. 

Then, I started working on my research paper to gather all my research findings and how data quality issues can affect a user who is trying to use AI-assited tools to create visualizations.
