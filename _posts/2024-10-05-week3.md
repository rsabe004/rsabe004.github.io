I continued my task from last week, I realized that this took longer than I anticipated due to the dataset I chose. For this experiment, I used The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access dataset which included a plethora of issues including missing values, inconsistent information, missing documentation, possible duplication, mixed text, and numeric data. Some visualizations took longer than others to fix and many visualization errors were encountered in the process. I shared my findings with Professor Fariha and we discussed the different types of data issues and how they can affect data visualizations. I read another research paper about data mirages to help me understand the topic more. 

We did not have a research paper discussion this week as Thursday was a holiday (4th of July).
