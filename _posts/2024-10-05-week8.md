I continued with my experimental study and started injecting the next issue into the datset and noting any observations down. I noticed some patterns across the results and shared my observations with professor Fariha during our meeting this week. 

This week was the final research paper discussion meeting with the team. It was about the paper "TabEE: Tabular Embeddings Explanations" and was led by one of the grad students on the team.
