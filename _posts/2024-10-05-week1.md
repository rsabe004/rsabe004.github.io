title: Week 2
---

During this week, I presented my findings from week 1 to Professor Fariha, had a discussion about my observations, and recieved feedback regarding the experiment. Then, I was my given my next task which was to find an unclean dataset and perform the same experiment as last week and document steps, errors encountered, time taken to fix each error, the level of complexity, and what conclusion I drew from each visualization. I pre-experiment reading consisted of DataPrism: Exposing Disconnect between Data and Systems by Sainyam Galhotra, Anna Fariha, et al.

I also met the lab team this week for the first time and was introduced to them during our weekly research literature reviews. Each week on Thursdays, a member of the team signed up for a research paper to present to the group and lead a discussion for. This week's discussion was on Table-GPT: Table-tuned GPT for Diverse Table Tasks.
