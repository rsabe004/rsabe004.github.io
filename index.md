## About Me

Hi! My name is Rania Saber and I am a recent June 2024 grad from the University of California, Riverside with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Psychology. I have a great interest in data, human-computer interaction, and design. I plan on pursuing a Master's in either HCI or data after my gap year. In my free time, I enjoy sketching, playing tennis, and listening to a variety of different genres of music.

## About My Mentor

My DREU mentor is Anna Fariha, an Assistant Professor at Kahlert School of Computing, the University of Utah. She co-leads the Data Management Research Center for Human-centered, Efficient, and Scalable Systems. For more information, you can visit her [site here.](https://afariha.github.io/) 

## About My Project

My research project with Dr. Fariha focuses on investigating data usability and developing methods to enhance data utility for users. This involves identifying challenges users face when creating data visualizations and documenting the solutions we implement to address these challenges. Subsequently, we aim to devise automated solutions to streamline these fixes, ultimately simplifying the data visualization process for users.
