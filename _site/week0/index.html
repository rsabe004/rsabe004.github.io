    <meta name="description" content="For my first week, I had initial meeting with Professor Fariha and went over details of the project and established a schedule to meet twice a week. I read five research papers relating to my project to gain further insight and background information about the topic. My first task was to fix imperfect data visualizations given by ChatGPT using a clean dataset. I used the 911 Emergencies dataset on Kaggle to create 10 different visualizations using Python on Google Colab. Then, I documented my steps and any errors expereinced with the code along the way and found solutions to the errors in the AI-generated code.
