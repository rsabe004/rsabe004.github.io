    <p>It was finally time for the experimental study. My next task was to gather 10 different datasets and inject 1 data quality issue into each dataset. Then, I chose 5 visual tasks for each dataset and observed the visualization errors given the data quality issues. I gathered clean 10 datasets from Kaggle. The first dataset I was working with was the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024. The 5 visualizations I chose were: pie chart, word cloud, histogram, heat map, and scatter plot.</p>

<p>This week it was my turn to lead a discussion on a research paper with the lab group. The research paper I presented was Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language Models. I read the paper and created a slide deck for it to present. I found it interesting as it related to my research project and I saw similiarities between this paper and my project. I discussed this paper with the lab group and presented to them my current project to draw a connection between this paper any my research.</p>
