  <h1>Week 7</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I created a Google Colab link with for the first dataset: the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024. I observed the dataset to take note of any pre-existing errors before injecting data issues into the dataset. I noted some encoding errors where some characters were not utf-8. This caused incorrect information within the visualization to be portrayed. These errors were fixed by adding an encoding to the script when reading in the file.</p>

<p>I met with Professor Fariha to discuss any hypotheses I had about which data issues would be more prominent than others and how they would appear in each visualization.</p>

<p>This week’s research paper discussion was on Auto-Formula: Recommend Formulas in Spreadsheets using Learned Table Representations.</p>
